- Install Dependencies
  npm install

## Validation and Error Handling

- **Validation**: Zod is used to validate request bodies for creating orders and bikes.
- **Error Handling**: Custom middleware ensures all errors are handled uniformly.

Example error response:

```json
{
  "message": "Validation error",
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "path": ["email"],
    "message": "Invalid email address"
  }
}
```

## Future Enhancements

- Add user authentication and authorization.
- Implement additional analytics for orders and revenue.
- Integrate with a frontend for seamless UI interaction.
